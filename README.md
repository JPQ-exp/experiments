experiments of mathematical model

Here I place files related with my mathematical model for biological systems.

The model number 61, is the version most close to the model I've been working on. 61 had a bug, 67c is the one that works. Now I uploaded a new version of the model with random cluster generation and also visualization (in the form of a graph) on the output, is the 5b1, and the counterpart with random regulation as well is also uploaded ( it also has a graph in the output).
